This directory contains small, self-contained examples.

Recommended entry points:
- `public_quick_start.py` – minimal public API usage (mock LLM; no external APIs)
- `hello_insight.py` – tiny geDIG gauge demo (F, ΔEPC_norm, ΔIG)
- `hello_gating.py` – minimal AG/DG gating behavior

Advanced/older demos (larger PoC, older APIs) have been archived under:
- `archive/examples_legacy/`
