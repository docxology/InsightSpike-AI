## 1. Cold Email for arXiv Endorsement

**Subject:** Inquiry regarding your work on [Paper Title] / Request for arXiv endorsement (cs.AI)

**Body:**

Dear [Author Name],

I am writing to you because I have been greatly inspired by your work on [Paper Title/Topic], particularly your insights into [Specific Concept from their paper, e.g., memory consolidation, dynamic graphs, etc.].

I am an independent researcher/developer working on a project called **InsightSpike-AI**, which attempts to implement a "Sleep" phase for RAG systems.
The core idea is to use a unified gauge (geDIG) based on the Free Energy Principle to autonomously optimize the knowledge graph structure offline—essentially, **"sleeping" to consolidate memory and discover shortcuts.**

I have implemented a Proof-of-Concept where the system dynamically rewires its own graph structure (what I call a "Dynamic Transformer" architecture) to reduce inference cost and improve long-term consistency.

I have prepared a preprint of my paper, **"geDIG: A Unified Gauge for Dynamic Knowledge Graphs"**, and I am hoping to submit it to **arXiv (cs.AI / cs.LG)**.
However, as an independent researcher, I require an endorsement to submit.

Given your expertise in this field, I would be honored if you could review my abstract (and the paper/code if you have time) and consider providing an endorsement.

**Project Repository:** https://github.com/miyauchikazuyoshi/InsightSpike-AI
**Abstract & Key Concepts:** [Link to PDF or README]

Thank you very much for your time and for your inspiring research.

Best regards,

**Title:**
I implemented "Sleep" for RAG. It optimizes its own graph structure offline to reduce inference cost.

**Body:**

Hi everyone,

I've been working on an experimental RAG system that mimics the biological **"Sleep" (Memory Consolidation)** process.

**The Problem:**
Standard RAG keeps adding data to the vector DB forever. It gets slower, costlier, and noisier over time. It never "organizes" its memory.

**The Solution (InsightSpike-AI):**
I implemented a **"Sleep Phase"** (offline optimization) using a Free Energy Principle-based gauge called **geDIG**.
1.  **Awake (Phase 1):** It explores and retrieves information dynamically (like standard RAG).
2.  **Sleep (Phase 2):** When offline, it "dreams" (replays logs), prunes unused connections, and **creates shortcuts** (rewiring) based on information gain.

**Result:**
It effectively becomes a **"Dynamic Transformer"** that optimizes its own topology.
In my Maze navigation PoC, it learned to find shortest paths autonomously without external supervision, significantly reducing the "inference cost" (steps taken) over time.

I'm an independent researcher and would love to hear your feedback on this architecture!
