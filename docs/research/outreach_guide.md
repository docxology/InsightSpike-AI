# Outreach Targets & Posting Guide

## 1. Potential Endorsers (arXiv: cs.AI / cs.LG)

Based on your `references.bib`, here are the recommended targets. They are likely to appreciate the specific angle of your work.

### Group A: Graph Edit Distance & Graph Matching (The "Structure" Angle)
*   **Target:** Authors of "A comprehensive survey on graph matching problems..." (Zeng et al., 2021) or "Graph Similarity Computation and Learning" (Bai et al., 2021).
*   **Why:** They understand the difficulty of GED. Your "One-Gauge" approach (using $\Delta EPC$ as a proxy) is a direct application of their field to RAG.
*   **Pitch:** "I applied approximate GED to optimize RAG knowledge graphs dynamically."

### Group B: Neuroscience & FEP (The "Sleep" Angle)
*   **Target:** Authors of "Latent learning..." (Lampinen et al., 2025) or "The Information-Theoretic Imperative" (Dittrich & Kinne, 2025).
*   **Why:** They are actively researching the intersection of memory, learning, and information theory. "Sleep for RAG" is exactly the kind of experimental evidence they might be looking for.
*   **Pitch:** "I implemented a 'Sleep' phase for RAG based on the Free Energy Principle."

### Group C: RAG & Knowledge Graphs (The "Application" Angle)
*   **Target:** Authors of "QA-GNN" (Yasunaga et al., 2021) or "GraphRAG" (Microsoft Research).
*   **Why:** They are your direct competitors/colleagues. They will be interested in how you solved the "dynamic update" problem.
*   **Pitch:** "Unlike static GraphRAG, my system optimizes its own topology offline."

## 2. Posting Guide

### Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com)

1.  **Timing:**
    *   Best time: Weekdays, **7:00 AM - 9:00 AM PT** (Japan time: 23:00 - 25:00).
    *   Avoid weekends (traffic is lower).

2.  **Title Strategy:**
    *   Use the "Show HN" prefix if you are sharing your own work.
    *   **Title:** `Show HN: I implemented "Sleep" for RAG to optimize graph structure offline`
    *   Alternative: `Show HN: InsightSpike - A RAG system that sleeps and dreams to consolidate memory`

3.  **First Comment:**
    *   Immediately after posting, write a comment explaining the "Why" and "How".
    *   Include the link to the **Maze GIF** (hosted on GitHub or Imgur) to catch attention.
    *   Keep it technical but accessible.

### Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA)

1.  **Subreddits:**
    *   `r/LocalLLaMA`: Highly active, loves practical tools and optimizations. Very friendly to independent devs. **Start here.**
    *   `r/MachineLearning`: More academic/strict. Use the `[Project]` tag. Good for deep discussion but harder to please.

2.  **Post Format:**
    *   **Type:** Link Post (linking to GitHub) or Text Post (with embedded images/video). Text Post is often better for storytelling.
    *   **Title:** `[Project] I built a RAG system that "sleeps" to reorganize its knowledge graph (Free Energy Principle)`
    *   **Body:**
        *   **Hook:** "RAG gets slow and messy. Humans sleep to fix memory. Why not AI?"
        *   **Tech:** Briefly explain geDIG (One-Gauge).
        *   **Demo:** Embed the Maze GIF directly.
        *   **Code:** Link to GitHub.

3.  **Engagement:**
    *   Reply to every comment.
    *   Be humble ("I'm exploring this idea") rather than salesy ("Best RAG ever").
