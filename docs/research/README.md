# Appendix — Long‑Term Notes (AGI & Governance)

This appendix collects a small set of long‑horizon notes that sit one step
outside the main geDIG / Phase‑1 implementation.

These documents are **research notes, not specifications**. They are intended
for readers who want to see how InsightSpike‑AI connects to:

- AGI foundations (world model, insight vs understanding)
- System‑level architecture (GNN‑Transformer perspective)
- Governance and rights (maker sovereignty after powerful AI)

## Included Notes

- `self_organizing_world_model.md`  
  Dynamic world‑model “brewing” in vector space; geDIG as a potential field
  for a self‑organizing knowledge geometry.

- `insight_vs_understanding.md`  
  Distinguishes “understanding” (structuring existing knowledge) from
  “insight” (emergent hypotheses), and sketches corresponding mechanisms.

- `insightspike_as_gnn_transformer.md`  
  Interprets InsightSpike as a GNN‑Transformer hybrid, and connects geDIG to
  energy‑based views of attention and structure.

- `maker_sovereignty_full_proposal_en.md`  
  Proposal for a semi‑decentralized infrastructure for digital ownership and
  safety (“maker sovereignty”), including OSS/AI governance after powerful AI.

Again, these are exploratory notes. The normative behavior of the system is
defined by:

- The geDIG paper (`docs/paper/geDIG_onegauge_improved_v5.{tex,pdf}`)
- The public spec (`docs/gedig_spec.md`)
- The main architecture and experiment docs under `docs/`.
